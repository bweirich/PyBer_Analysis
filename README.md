# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis inspects ride share data for PyBer regarding the type of city and its relationship the other variable.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine summarize the different metric of rides shares based on the city type.  These city types include:
- Urban
- Suburban
- Rural
The metrics we are going to look at based on city type are:
- Total number of rides
- Total number of drivers
- Total fares
- Average fare per ride
- Average fare per driver
- Total fare by city type
The results of this summary will help to determine the profitability of a city type and factors that affect the profitability.

## Results

### Overview of Results
The overview of results show that urban areas have a larger number of rides given as well as the highest number of drivers.  Urban fares on a whole tend to be lower.  Suburban number of rides, number of drivers and fares tend to fall in the middle.  Rural areas tend to have the lowest number of rides and the lowest number of drivers.  Rural areas tend to have the highest overall fares and the highest variance in fare price.  The overall results can be seen in the table and graph below.

### Number of Rides by City Type
The number of rides was highest for Urban areas and lowest for Rural areas.  Urban areas also had the largest range of number or rides and Rural areas had the smallest range.  Urban areas account for the largest percentage of rides at 68.45 of all rides and Rural areas account for the smallest at 5.3%.  These findings can be seen below.

### Number of Drivers by City Type
The number of drivers in an area on average was highest for Urban areas and lowest for Rural areas.  Urban areas had the largest range of number of drivers and Rural areas had the smallest range.  Urban areas account for the largest percentage of drivers at 80.9% and Rural areas account for smallest at 16.5%.  These findings can be seen below.

### Ride Fare by City Type
On average Rural areas had the highest fare price for rides and Urban areas had the lowest fare price.  Rural areas had the largest range of fares and Suburban areas had the smallest.  Urban areas account for the largest percentage of fares at 62.7% of all fares and Rural areas account for the smallest at 6.8%.  These findings can be seen below.

### Weekly Fares by City Type
The total fares of each city type at weekly intervals over a four month period show that the fares overall were pretty consistent, and all city types showed the same trends.  These findings can be seen below.

## Summary
Overall, the most profitable type of city is Urban which is in large part to the number of total rides.  There is a larger number of drivers in Urban areas than rides given which causes the fare per ride to be lower and fare per driver to be lower. Rural areas on the other hand have fewer drivers than rides given driving up the fare per ride and per driver.  Suburban areas fall in between these two extremes.  

### Recommendations
1. An incentive to urban drivers to work in suburban or rural areas to increase the number of drivers which would allow the number of overall rides given to increase.  This would help to even out the disparity between total rides and total drivers.
2. Further gathering of data on the duration of rides as this may be a factor in the price of fares for the different city types.  Rural or Suburban ride duration may be longer than Urban ride times.
3. Further gathering of data on the population of the city types would allow the percentage of the population that uses PyBer to be determined.  This city type could then be targeted to increase the number of rides which will in turn increase profits.
